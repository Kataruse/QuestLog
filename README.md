# Game Backlog Web Application - Algorithms Project

## Description
A project assigned to us by Matthew Harrison that must address atleast on of the following learning objectives.

* Explain the use of asymptotic notation and complexity theory in describing the amount of work done by an algorithm.
* Demonstrate an understanding of proof techniques used to prove algorithmic correctness.
* Use and solve recurrence relations to determine the time complexity of recursively defined algorithms.
* Given a problem, determine an appropriate algorithmic strategy and data structure to solve the problem efficiently.
* Describe models of computation and their relationship to complexity classes and the analysis of algorithms.
